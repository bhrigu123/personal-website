## Hey 👋🏼, I am Bhrigu

My name is derived from भृगु (/Sanskrit/), who was a rishi and one of the seven great sages in ancient India.

To put it in one line, I'll just say - I love software. And with that I love to build things which I and others may find useful.
Over several years in the tech industry, I've worked on a variety of projects, both at work and on my own.

When I'm not working I like to - drink chai, workout, play soccer, and enjoy music.
