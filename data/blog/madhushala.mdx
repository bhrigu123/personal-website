<div className="text-center">
मदिरालय जाने को घर से चलता है पीनेवला,  
\[ The drinker leaves his home to find a tavern \]  

'किस पथ से जाऊँ?' असमंजस में है वह भोलाभाला,  
\[ However, he does not know the way. 'Which path should I choose?' \]  

अलग-अलग पथ बतलाते सब पर मैं यह बतलाता हूँ -  
\[ Everyone else he asks tells him different direction every time. However, what I tell you is: \]  

'राह पकड़ तू एक चला चल, पा जाएगा मधुशाला।'  
\[ Just choose one path, and you\'ll find the tavern \]  
</div>

> We all leave our homes to build our career, explore places, and experience life.  
It can be a maze sometimes, and you won't always know which direction to go towards. 
The poet assures that you will find what you're looking for (could be a destination, short or long term goals, or enlightemnemt), by any path you choose and if you just continue 
to move forward.

सुन कल कल, छल छल, मधुघट से गिरती प्यालों में हाला,  
\[ Listen to the sounds of cups clinking, and alchohol flowing from pitchers to the cups \]   

सुन रुनझुन रुनझुन जल वितरण, करती मधु साक़ी बाला  
\[ Listen, the sounds of water bubbling, as the bartender girl pours it for the thirsty \]  

बस आ पहुँचे, दूर नहीं  
बस आ पहुँचे, दूर नहीं, कुछ चार कदम अब चलना है,  
\[ We are almost there. It's not too far now. Just a few steps more \]  

चहक रहे सुन पीनेवाले, महक रही ले मधुशाला  
\[ Hear the drinkers laughing and enjoying; and smell the aroma of the tavern \]  
</div>


> We can almost picture what it's like out there. In the real world. Listen to the people hustling. Working hard, having fun, and celebrating. Enjoying the simple pleasures of life. The poet invites us to join the celebration. We just have to continue. One step at a time.  It all looks very appealing, where you're headed to. You can almost feel that energy.

लाल सुरा की धार लपट सी कह न इसे देना ज्वाला  
\[ Don\'t call this flaming red wine a fire \]  

फेनिल मदिरा है, मत इसको कह देना उर का छाला  
\[ Don't call this frothing beer a hole in the heart \]  

दर्द नशा है इस मदिरा का, विगत स्मृतियाँ साकी हैं  
\[ The liquour makes pain an addiction. And all the past memories are like bartenders pouring you the liquour \]  

पीड़ा में आनंद जिसे हो, आए मेरी मधुशाला  
\[ Anyone who finds pleasure in pain, is welcome to my tavern \]
</div>

> Everyone faces hardships in life. Every one has experienced bad times in the past. We must understand that any difficult situation is not as bad as it seems. All things must pass.   
Also, pain can be an addiction. How? Because you know it's going to make you a better person, and tougher than before.    
All those difficult times in the past are not the holes in your heart. They are like bartenders of life pouring you the wine. They are working 'For' you. And the pain you feel is actually intoxicating and exhilirating.  
Accept life along with all the pain that it throws at you. Rejoice by being drunk on the pain. The poet calls upon those who, during pain, are still optimistic, and find pleasure in it.

<div className="text-center">
धर्मग्रन्थ सब जला चुकी है, जिसके अंतर की ज्वाला,  
\[ One whose inner flame has destroyed all the holy books \]

मंदिर, मसजिद, गिरिजे, सब को तोड़ चुका जो मतवाला,  
\[ that drunk, who has destroyed the idea of temples, mosques, and churches \]

पंडित, मोमिन, पादिरयों के फंदों को जो काट चुका,  
\[ One who has broken free from the shackles of the pundits and preachers \]

कर सकती है आज उसी का स्वागत मेरी मधुशाला  
\[ Such people are welcome to my tavern \] 
</div>


> To truly grow, you must be willing to free yourself from anything holding you back — whether it's societal expectations, peer pressure, religious beliefs, or the boundaries of your own comfort zone. Stay open to new perspectives and mindsets instead of clinging tightly to an identity that may be keeping you from stepping out into the world. Let go of any deep attachments to beliefs you've built over time; openness to change is key to finding new possibilities.

एक बरस में, एक बार ही जगती होली की ज्वाला,  
\[ The Holi (festival of colors) bonfire burns only once a year \]  

एक बार ही लगती बाज़ी, जलती दीपों की माला,  
\[ The Diwali (festival of lights) lanterns are only lit up once a year \]  

दुनियावालों, किन्तु, किसी दिन आ मदिरालय में देखो,  
\[ But, people of the world, come and see what it's like in the tavern some day \]

दिन को होली, रात दिवाली, रोज़ मनाती मधुशाला  
\[ Here, the everyone celebrates these festivities day and night everyday \]
</div>

> Those who seek meaning find inspiration not just for a day or two, like the annual festivals. Their drive sustains them daily, each morning a fresh beginning. For them, every day is a celebration; they rejoice in life day and night.

<div className="text-center">
अधरों पर हो कोई भी रस जिहवा पर लगती हाला,  
\[ No matter what juice touches my lips, it feels like wine to my tongue  \]

भाजन हो कोई हाथों में लगता रक्खा है प्याला,  
\[ No matter what I'm holding with my hand, it feels like a wine glass \]

हर सूरत साकी की सूरत में परिवर्तित हो जाती,  
\[ Every face in front of me turns into the face of a wine server \]

आँखों के आगे हो कुछ भी, आँखों में है मधुशाला  
[ No matter what's in front of me, I only see the tavern in my eyes ]
</div>

> You get into a state of flow when you’re fully absorbed in your purpose. Nothing around you can distract you. All you see before you are your ambitions. You control your attitude towards the behaviors of other people around you. You choose to see everyone around you contributing to your cause. The circumstances around you has little significance - you remain focused on your work.

### Notes
1. I will continue adding more of the poem’s most inspiring verses. (The poem actually has as 135 verses). I keep coming back to it from time to time whenever I feel lost.
2. Some external sources I referenced: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhushala), [quora answer](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-line-phrase-para-of-Madhushala-by-Harivansh-Rai-Bachchan/answer/पल्केश-असावा-Palkesh-Asawa?ch=10&oid=62112937&share=4c0bcb4c&srid=t8AQ&target_type=answer) 
3. People may have different interpretations of some of the verses from what I've written above. But that's the beauty of poetry. You can make it your own.
