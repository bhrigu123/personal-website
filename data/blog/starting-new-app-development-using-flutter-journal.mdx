Hey, there! This post is a journal of sorts, of my journey in learning and building a mobile app. 



### Introduction
> Oct 25th, 2020

It's been long since I built or worked on a personal project, outside of my work. Back in college times I would spin up a website in a matter of couple of days, and start publicising it around. Today it's hard to imagine there were days I had the energy and determination to do all that. Probably having a full time job is enough to expend the resources my body has for a brain intensive work. There's only so much a mind can do. Or, maybe I'm just a lazy-ass.

I always wanted to learn mobile app development and build some useful ones. These days there are so many framework and options available to create apps that studying about them would in itself take a lot of time. I decided to get my hands dirty with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) based on some exploration and discussing with my brother.

### New programming language and tools
> Nov 1st, 2020

Development in Flutter will require ramping up on a new programming language called [Dart](https://dart.dev/), and also on the Flutter components.  
To me Dart is looking like a combination of Java and JavaScript.  
Since I've never done mobile app development, I'll need to get some insights of the development style and practices in that space.

### An Idea
> Nov 7th, 2020

I always liked the idea of building something for myself first, and put it out for public if required. This way, I could get the customer feedback and ideas directly from the customer itself - which is me. 

For example - a script which I wrote for myself - which organizes your files in a given directory, received [900+ stars on Github](https://github.com/bhrigu123/classifier). Or, [an app I wrote for Linux](https://github.com/bhrigu123/Instant-Lyrics) which can instantly show lyrics of a currently plaing Spotify, [got featured in a major Linux blog, **OMG! Ubuntu**](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/03/get-lyrics-spotify-track-ubuntu-desktop).  

These days, I really need a way to track and manage my work-life balance. Specially track if I'm spending enough time on my presonal growth, skills and health, and what I'm doing for each one of those. At the same time, am I being productive and efficient in my job's work? What are my long and short term goals, and how am I progressing towards those? Am I utilizing my daily time effectively? Also, can I get a simple summarized view of all of the above to act as a constant remider for myself to stay productive, effective and healthy?

It seems like too much bundled up in a single app. I don't really know how it'll shape up. Let's see!

### Inspiration and headstart
> Nov 8th, 2020

Back in college days, if ever I needed to inspire myself to build something, I would watch the movie **The Social Network**. That really did it.  
Thinking of following the same tradition and see if it still works. 

I'll really need myself to invest more time in this in order to have something *shippable* soon. Having a full time job, I'll only have the weeknights and some parts of weekends for this, given how much scrren-time I can take.

### Initial set up and app
> Nov 18th, 2020

It was Diwali last Saturday. Due to the ongoing pandemic, we couldn't go out much like we used to before. It was a Lockdown Diwali.

I also got distracted by exploring other blogging frameworks out there. There hasn't been any progress in Octopress and looks like it's no longer maintained. There are a bunch of newer and better blogging tools available now. One such framework called [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) caught my attention which sounds promising. It's really fast and full of features. I had been trying it out and exploring its different themes.  
Even though there are hundreds of its themes available, I couldn't really set my mind on any. Not sure what I want in a theme. I really like the [github blog theme](https://github.blog/) and would be great to get (or build) something like that.

Anyway, back to focus, sorry - I did an initial set up of Flutter and built a simple To Do list app. It's amazing to see how much features and widgets Flutter provides out of the box. With very little amount of code, I was able to do a lot.

Currently the app just stores the data in its state (memory). Will be learning about networking and disk storage.

### Firebase - the cool backend
> Nov 29th, 2020 
 
I started exploring Firebase (Backend as a Service platform) to build features like authentication and storage. It's amazing to see what Google has built (both Firebase and Flutter) which are top class products for developers to build and deploy apps. 

With very easy integrations, I was able to set up an Email/password based user authentication, and set up a Firestore DB to save and retrieve the To-Do List tasks.

Now that I've gotten the basics of Flutter widgets building and Firebase integrations, it's time to think about what my app should look like. I still need to figure out how exactly I can achieve what I intend to (which I talked about earlier) since it is very abstract. It'll depend on person-to-person what fits best for them. But since, for a start, I'm building it for myself, I can think about a few ideas for myself.


Also to add, I had been a bit occupied recently. I bought an electric guitar which I've been learning regularly. I also worked with my brother to record a talk video for his YouTube channel, about working on side projects. Also, some of these times had been hard. Never knew it could be so hard to even move on with someone. Now, it's almost Nov 30th. Playing guitar and coding for personal projects really takes the mind off certain things and gets me in this zone where nothing else matters.
