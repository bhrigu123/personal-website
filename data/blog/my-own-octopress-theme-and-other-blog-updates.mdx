Recently, I have been doing a lot of changes in my blog's layout and pages, to incorporate better readability, good looking pages and make it less cramped. 


Mid-way I realised that it would be nice if I also made my theme available for use to other octopress bloggers. So instead of doing changes to my own site, I started working on creating a theme module, which any octopress user can install on his/her site instantly.


Customizing and installing themes in Octopress is really simple.


Earlier I was using a 3rd party theme called [octostrap3](https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3), and I had done a lot of modifications in it to suit my needs. 

The final result ended up in a much different (and better) looking theme which I compiled to create my own theme module, and called it _**Abacus**_.


I chose the name _Abacus_ such that my theme appears on the top in the list of [3rd party Octopress themes](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes), where they are arranged in alphabetical order. Plus it sounds cool.


The theme is available at: [Abacus](https://github.com/bhrigu123/abacus).


I had also done several other changes to my own site and created some more pages like:

* [About Me](/about)
* [Music](/music)


Here are 2 screenshots of the Abacus theme (in case I'm using some other theme in the future):

Well...that's all for this post.
