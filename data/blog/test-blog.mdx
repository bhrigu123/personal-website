Oh, hey! Don't mind, this is just a test blog. I don't really have anything on my mind on what to put down on this one. I overslept the last night, had some relaxing nap some time later, and here I am super awake at midnight.  


The next thing I know, I am lying down on my bed with my laptop and a bluetooth speaker playing some of my faourite songs, and I'm doing a `rake new_post[]` on my *Octopress* blog. Well, to add, it has been more than a year and a half since I wrote any new article on my blog. I have been trying to get back on blogging for a while now, and this should give me some boost (hopefully!).

Right now I am in home (Delhi) for the week of Diwali. Noticed the air pollution the moment I stepped out of the airport. The weather has cooled down and been decent enough. It's pretty much the same as was in Hyderabad when I left.  


My brother also flew over from Canada and had landed yesterday. It has  almost been a year and a half since he moved to Canada and this is the first time he got the opportunity to come home since then. He's still jet lagged and tired from the 22+ hours of flight though (fortunately there was no crying toddler this time in his neighbouring seat like last time, as he claims).

Had some pretty good talk over some coffee at CCD in the morning today.

He brought along some interesting stuff including a pair of *allbirds* shoes, a bluetooth speaker and a *Green Day* shirt.

Currently playing - *Mr. Brightside* - on those bluetooth spearkers. It's a killer song ( pun intended;) ).  
Now that we are talking about music, I had quite to share about it. Recently, I have started listening to lots of different Rock (mostly Classic) songs, that it feels like for more than half of the time in my day I'm listing to some song or other. I discoverd lots of new songs (like Last Nite (The Strokes), D'yer Mak'er (Led Zeppelin), etc.) and have made a pretty good Rock n Roll collection on my Spotify playlist.
I have so much to talk about some of the new songs I discovered and about my music interests that it's going to take a whole new blog post to write about it (Ah! I just got the idea for a future blog post).


Okay! What else to write about? I am staring at my good 'ol study table standing in the corner of my room. Okay, I don't know why I'm thinking over a table so much now. Probably because I've had it since pretty much the beginning of when we moved into this house (in 2010). Had gone through my 10th and 12th board exams with it, along with the engineering entrances, college work, competitive coding, development projects, interview preps and playing FIFA 14 endlessly. Some great ideas and projects have originated from this table:)

Now, for the first time none of my 2 best school / childhood friends are here in Delhi when I am here. One's doing Masters in US and the other started working in Mondelez (Cadbury's parent) as a *Chocolate Engineer* (that's a pretty cool job title).  Remembering those endless FIFA gaming sesssions at Dhyani's house, lots of extensive cycling in the streets of Delhi, playing football, frisbees and what not back in the days with Himalaya, Dhyani and others. 

Man, it's getting really late now.

Oh, I didn't really finish publishing this post yesterday. Since I am not really writing about anything particular, I'm not sure how / when to end this one.  

Anyways, now I'm shuffling my [Rock n Roll playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/22lwls5bnkxt55mldsdzy7ewy/playlist/6BFsxdsXJ0e8OnFJrzNC52?si=qhED8gK0RgKjnamNk3tbXg) and currently it's playing David Bowie's *Rebel Rebel*. Fantastic song!


So, today I took my trusty Firefox Cyclone D out for a cleaning and air re-fill. It was a wonderful feeling to get back on the tracks and ride along the wind. Can never get enough of it.

Well, I'm really tired now and I think I should just end this blog post now.

Happy Diwali, y'all!
