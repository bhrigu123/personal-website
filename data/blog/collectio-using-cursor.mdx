I finally tried the hyped AI powered Code Editor: Cursor AI

It feels like having an assistant tool right next to your editor. No more copy pasting your code into browser to find answers or debug issues. I somehow get reminded of that clippy assistant that came with Microsoft Office.

Things are definitely changing in the way we build software. I don't think AI can do all the work for you (as of now), so you can't get away without knowing how to write code. But it definitely speeds up development.

It is really good at solving small tasks. But for solving project level ambiguities, there's still scope for improvement. It can't get the context of the whole project at once, but only one or few files at a time. For me it also kept forgetting that I'm using the v5 (beta) of Next Auth.

But this is still a great leap. I have never found answers or debugged issues as fast as I could with Cursor. The auto-complete feature is really nice especially when you don't remember the syntax of every little thing.

And about the app that I built - Nothing too special, it's just a simple *Collections* app. You can list your collections of things you find meaningful. And you can easily get back to it when you want to recall those things. Collections you build are public so you can share with anyone you want.
