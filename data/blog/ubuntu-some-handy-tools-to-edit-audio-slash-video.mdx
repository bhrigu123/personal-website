There are several tools & libraries to edit audio/video files in Linux, such as change dimensions, video converter, resize/rotate images etc.

Mainly we'll use `avconv`, which can be used as command line in __Linux__.


### 1. Resize / Rotate images
In __Ubuntu__, use **nautilus-image-converter**. It adds 2 new menu items, when you right click an image: resize and rotate. To install, run the command on your terminal:

`sudo apt-get install nautilus-image-converter`

Restart nautilus by running `nautilus -q` , and open your file browser. Right click on an image to see options for Resizing and Rotating.

You can even resize multiple images by selecting those images, right click and Resize.

### 2. Trim / cut an audio or video
Use a command line tool `avconv` to trim audio/video. Install as:

`sudo apt-get install libav-tools`

To trim an audio/video run the command

`avconv -i srcFileName -c:a copy -c:v copy -ss 00:03:40 -t 00:01:12 targetFileName`

Time parameter is given in format **hh:mm:ss** 

The first time parameter is the start time. The second time parameter is the **duration** of the clip that you want from the start time. (*not the end time*)

### 3. Change video resolution
Again `avconv` is used for this. (install as stated above)

For eg. to change resolution of a video to __640x480__, run the command

`avconv -i video.mp4 -s 640x480 output.mp4`



*[Note]: If the above command doesn't run and gives you a warning to run with -strict -2, Run the command as `avconv -i video.mp4 -s 640x480 -strict -2 output.mp4`*

### 4. Change video format
Using avconv to change format of a video, for eg, from `mov` to `mp4`. (install as stated above)

`avconv -i video.mov -strict -2 output.mp4`

---

### 5. Extract audio from Video file
Using avconv, run the command

`avconv -i video.mp4 -vn -f mp3 sound.mp3`
