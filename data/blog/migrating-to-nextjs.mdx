It has been three years, and I hadn't migrated my blog to yet another framework?

(Just kidding, I've easily stayed for at least 4 years on one of the older frameworks)

But this time it is none other than **NextJS**. 
Now this looks promising and something I may hold on to for a very long time.

I enjoy learning React and I'm just amazed by its community's growth. 
People are building some of the most amazing libraries in Node. 
There's some satisfaction in writing JSX elements in Typescript, and letting React do the magic.

NextJS is gaining a lot of popularity and has surpassed most of the ReactJS frameworks. 
Personally I wanted to get back to web app development as well, and this looked pretty interesting. 
It was even better when I found that people are genrating their personal websites using NextJS. 
And I just had to do it as well.

When I discovered the [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) template, I was excited to get started with it. 
It's using some of the coolest libraries (Loving the Cmd+K command pallete search). 
For themeing it's using Tailwind CSS, which is simply an amazing CSS framework.
I'm doing a lot of my own updates for this website on top of that starter template.

I'm looking forward to customizing my site further. Add some more features, and tweak some UI 
(Do let me know if anyone has any thoughts around some of the features/components you'd want in your website/blog). 
But most importantly, do more writing. I had some thoughts around some of my future posts. Hope to get back on to writing more often.

Cheers!
