Sometimes it is quite convenient and quick to edit media files (for eg. resize images) via command line. Below are such helpful tools for Mac OS X. 


## Table of contents
1. [Images](#images)
2. [Videos](#videos)
3. [Audio](#audio)

## Images <a name="images"></a>
Mac has an inbuild CLI tool called *sips*. It modifies the images in-place. To save the updated image in a separate copy, use `--out [outfilename]` in the command.

#### Re-size image
`sips -z [height] [width] file.png`: Re-sizes image to specified dimensions, which may alter the actual aspect ratio.

`sips -Z [heightwidth] file.png`: This maintains the aspect ratio and [heightwidht] value will be the maximum value that can be for the height and width of the image (the other dimension will get set acc to its aspect ratio).

Example

    sips -z 640 480 file1.png
    sips -Z 640 file2.png


You can view the current dimension details of an image by looking at the image's info.


#### Rotate image
`sips -r [degrees] file.png`

Example:

    sips -r 90 file.jpg --out rotatedfile.jpg


Other options:  
`-f [horizontal or vertical]`: Flips the image  
`-c [pixelsH pixelsV]`: Crops the image to height and width  
Check out all the options available by doing `sips --help`


## Videos <a name="videos"></a>
For video editing via command line, you'll have to install a tool called `ffmpeg` which will make your life easier.

You can install using Homebrew:  

    $ brew install ffmpeg


#### Change format
Eg. convert mp4 to mov

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mov

*Tip: You can also make gifs from video using this command*


#### Change resolution / dimension
Eg. Change video resolution to 1280x720. Can be used to reduce the resolution and therefore the size

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:a copy -s 1280x720 output.mp4

#### Trim video
Eg. 1) Trim from 00:00:10 to 00:00:20 (hh:mm:ss)

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:00:10 -to 00:00:20 -c copy output.mp4

Eg. 2) Trim ten seconds starting from 00:01:00

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:av copy -ss 00:01:00 -t 10 output.mp4


#### Extract audio from video
    ffmpeg -i clip.mp4 -vn audio_only.mp3


## Audio <a name="audio"></a>
We are going to use the same command line tool *ffmpeg* to edit audio files too. If you don't have it, install it via Homebrew.

    $ brew install ffmpeg

The commands are same as the commands for editing the videos actually.

#### Trim audio
Eg. Trim from 00:00:20 to 00:00:40 (hh:mm:ss)

    ffmpeg -ss -i input.mp3 00:00:20 -to 00:00:40 -c copy output.mp3


#### Change format
Eg. convert mp3 to wav

    ffmpeg -i input.mp3 output.wav


That's all for now. Hope you find these useful and get comfortable and quick with editing media files via Command Line.
