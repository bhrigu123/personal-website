2016 is almost over and I felt like writing again (which happens quite rarely). Trying to recollect few of the highilghts of this year, which was full of surprises, excitement and challenges.

__*Jan '16:*__  Launched [DTU Mart](http://dtumart.com), which is an online portal I made for my college students to exchange books with each other. It was such a thrill to launch another website. It received 200+ ads in the first 3 weeks of launch only, and gained great response.

Went a little light with publicity later, which I guess will have to work upon.

__*Feb '16:*__ Finished reading the *"A Song of Ice and Fire"* book series, which I started in the preceding December. I have no words to explain how awesome the book series was, and how it blew me away. 
Unable to wait for the next book, *The Winds of Winter*, I still re-read the whole series again & again.

After rocking on my electric guitar for the past years, it was time for some acoustic tunes.

__*Jun-Aug '16:*__ Amazon Internship 

Had an amazing time during my internship at Hyderabad. It was a great learning, networking, lots-of-new-things moment. (more about it on my previous [Blog post](http://bhrigu.me/blog/2016/10/12/hyderabad-moments-amazon-internship/) ) 

What added to the joy was the fact that I also received a PPO from Amazon, at the end of my intern.

*sigh*. feeling lazy to add more content. Guess I'll leave it to that. So long, 2016.

I don't make new year resolutions, I just live......in the moment.

Happy New Year, folks.
