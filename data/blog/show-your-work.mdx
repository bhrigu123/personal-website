_Show Your Work!_, by Austin Kleon, is I believe, is a very important book for founders and creators.

The main idea is:

- Whatever work you do, share your ideas, process, and journey online. Just put something out there - Share what you're learning or what you've built. Don’t be a hoarder.

And if you keep on doing that:

- The right people will find you, and you will build a community around what you do. Stick to the process and opportunities will come your way.

  ***

**Be an amateur**. Someone who is not afraid to make mistakes or worry about others’ opinion. They are willing to share anything and have an advantage over the professionals.

---

Share something small everyday. **Send out a daily dispatch**. Anything you learned, a small feature you added, some cool app you found, or what thoughts you had today.

---

Build a good **(domain) name**. But don’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine. Think of it as a self-invention machine. Fill it up with your ideas and the stuff you care about. Whether people show up or not, you’re out there, doing your thing, ready whenever they are. Don’t give up on it. Ever.

---

Share your influences and interests. [Curate your collections](https://collectio.app/). They clue people in to who you are, sometimes more than your work.

Austin debunks one of the biggest misconceptions about work that is, _work speaks for itself_. It doesn’t. _You_ have to speak for it. At the same time, you’ll need to learn how to be a good story teller. The stories you tell people about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel.

---

**Teach what you know**. Share your secrets. Teaching doesn’t mean instant competition. Just because you know the master’s technique doesn’t mean you can emulate it right away. When you teach something, you end up generating more interest about your work and people feel closer to you.

---

Don’t chase followers. They should be a natural outgrowth of doing things that you do anyway. Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love, and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff.

---

Learn to take a punch. The more you put stuff out there, the more chances of attracting some criticism. But let ‘em take their best shot. Never take any criticism personally. The more criticism you can take, the more you realize it **can’t hurt you**.

---

Don’t shy away from asking for money. Put a ‘**buy me a coffee**’ sign. If people are loving what you do they’ll throw away a few bucks your way. If you feel that the work you’re putting is truly worth something, don’t be afraid to charge for your work. Put a price on it that you think is fair.

---

**Don’t quit your show**. Every career is full of ups and downs. The people who get what they’re after are very often the ones who just stick around long enough.

---

**Chain-smoke**. Instead of taking a break between projects, waiting for feedbacks, and worrying what’s next, use the end of one project to light up the next one. Don’t lose momentum. You still shouldn’t burn out though and it’s okay to take breaks and mini-sabbaticals when you feel like it. You have to go away to come back.
