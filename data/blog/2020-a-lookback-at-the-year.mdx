Looking back at 2020, it was a confusing ride. It started off well in January, but Feb/March onwards was when it started to get...confusing. I guess it's all part of life to experience challenges in life. In the end it's all good.


Anyways, leaving that confusion apart, due to the lockdown I really got to try out things I didn't take out time to do earlier. I learnt cooking, more drums, keyboard, more guitar, got myself into reading again, and started to take gym seriously.

I also got a chance to learn motorcycle and also mastered my driving. I got more active on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqgqCOWlxpYDPH5whE6mb3Q) and made videos related to music and tech. I revamped my blog and got more into writing. I kick started learning Flutter and also NextJS. 

Going forward, I hope I continue to actively:
* Read
* Write
* Develop apps
* Learn
* Explore and Take risks
* Exercise and play sports

oh and most importantly, I ought to live more in the present than in the past.

That's all for that. Happy New Year :)
